    Making a README file who is generated by user input, would require installing all necessary packages for this challenge.
When the user opens the terminal, and insert node index.js in from the correct folder,
They are prompted with a series of questions in which determine the best README file they can get from what answers they input.
    As the user answers the questions, they are also directed to choose from a list of 5 licenses in which they will choose from those options.
User at the end of the list of questions being asked, can also enter in their github account name and email, which would be a link to enter those sites.
    When the user is satisfied with whatever input they inserted, they would then go into the README to see the final outcome of the answers they made and choices they picked. 
User will be able to click on the table of contents list and directly send them to that specific item within the README file.
